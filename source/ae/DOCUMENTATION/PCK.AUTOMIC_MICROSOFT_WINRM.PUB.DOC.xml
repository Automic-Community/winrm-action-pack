This action pack allows to execute commands on the target windows system where commands can be standard windows command(s), DOS command(s), 
Powershell command(s)/Powershell script block or any windows program. This action pack does not require agent OS to be present on the target system.

To execute the command on target system, it uses Powershell remoting which further requires WinRM to be enabled on the target system.

=Supported versions=
Powershell 4.0 or later

=Setup= 
* This action pack supports only WINDOWS Agent.
* The Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or later should be installed on agent OS.
* Enable WinRM on target system. In order to enable WinRM, please follow the below steps on target system.

Configure WinRM with default settings over HTTP
1. Run the command using command prompt: Winrm quickconfig
	You must run this command as an administrator.

2. When the tool displays Make these changes [y/n]?, Press y.
	If the configuration is successful, the following output will be displayed:
	
	WinRM has been updated for remote management.
	WinRM service type changed to delayed auto start.
	WinRM service started.
	Created a WinRM listener on HTTP://* to accept WS-Man requests to any IP on this machine.
	
3. Keep the default settings for client and server components of WinRM, or customize them. For example, you might need to add certain remote computers to the client configuration Trusted Hosts list. A trusted hosts list should be set up when mutual authentication cannot be established. Kerberos allows mutual authentication, but it cannot be used in workgroups, only domains. A best practice for setting up trusted hosts for a workgroup is to make the list should be as restricted as possible.
OR
   Configure the remote Windows machine for Basic authentication with custom settings. Run the following commands.
	setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion EnableExtensions
	title Configuring Windows Remote Management...
 
	cmd /c net stop winrm
	cmd /c winrm quickconfig -q
	cmd /c winrm quickconfig -transport:http
	cmd /c winrm set winrm/config @{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}
	cmd /c winrm set winrm/config/winrs @{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="2048"}
	cmd /c winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
	cmd /c winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
	cmd /c winrm set winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP @{Port="5985"}
	cmd /c sc config winrm start= auto
	cmd /c net start winrm
 
	cmd /c netsh firewall set service type=remoteadmin mode=enable
	cmd /c netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="remote administration" new enable=yes
	cmd /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Port 5985" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5985
	
Configure WinRM over HTTPS
1. Create an HTTPS listener by running the following command.
        winrm quickconfig -transport:https. 
              You must open port 5986 for HTTPS transport to work.

2. Next step is to create a certificate on the target machine that has FQDN as the hostname. For that, run a PowerShell cmdlet on that machine.
        New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName ssrmdvm3.southeastasia.cloudapp.azure.com -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My
	         Above command will create a self-signed certificate for testing purposes. The output of the command will show a thumbprint of the certificate. That thumbprint 
                 is a 40 digit number.	
	OR
        You can also create a self-signed certificate for the remote host by installing selfssl.exe usinf IIS 6 resource kit
	(http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=17275) and run the command as mentioned by reference 
	(http://www.hansolav.net/blog/SelfsignedSSLCertificatesOnIIS7AndCommonNames.aspx).
 
3. Open a PowerShell window and enter the following command to find the thumbprint for the certificate for the remote host:
	Get-childItem cert:\LocalMachine\Root\ | Select-String -pattern <HOSTNAME>
	
5. Delete the existing WinRM listener that is linked to SSL certificate with IP address and create a new listener that is linked to FQDN.
    To do so, you need to execute two cmdlets in succession:
	* winrm delete winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS
	* winrm create winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS '@{Hostname="vviespartan03.sbb01.spoc.global"; CertificateThumbprint="Copy the thumbprint from earlier cmdlet output";port="5986"}'
	E.g. winrm create winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS             
                                '@{Hostname="vviespartan03.sbb01.spoc.global";CertificateThumbprint="A588F550237477242C3D91649105CB7DD18AFD46";port="5986"}'
			
6. You can check  the configured listeners of WinRM by running the following command.
		winrm e winrm/config/listeners

=Variables=
(none)

=Common Input=
-Host name :                    Specify Host name of the remote WinRM server. E.g. vviespartan03.sbb01.spoc.global
-Port:                                Specify port number of WinRM server on which service is running. Default http\https port is 5985\5986.
-Domain\Username*:       Provide domain and username to connect WinRM server. E.g. SBB01\TESTUSER
-Password*:                     Provide password to connect WinRM server.
-Use SSL:                        If Yes, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol will be used to establish a connection to the remote computer. By default, SSL is not used.
-Authentication Type:      Specify the mechanism that is used to authenticate the user's credentials. E.g. Basic 
                                        Note: CredSSP authentication is available only in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later versions of the Windows operating system.
-Skip CA Check:              Specifies that when it connects over HTTPS, the client does not validate that the server certificate is signed by a trusted certification authority (CA).
-Skip CN Check:              Specifies that the certificate common name (CN) of the server does not have to match the host name of the server. This option is used only in remote 
                                        operations that use the HTTPS protocol.
-Connection Timeout:      Connection Timeout (In Seconds). If 0 - no timeout. Default value is 3
